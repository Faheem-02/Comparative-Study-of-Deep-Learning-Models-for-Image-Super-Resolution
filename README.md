  <p>Enhancing geospatial imagery using SRCNN and SRGAN: From low-res satellite photos to high-res masterpieces! üöÄüõ∞Ô∏è</p>

## üåü Overview
This repository presents a comparative analysis of two pioneering deep learning models for image super-resolution (SR) applied to geospatial imagery: **SRCNN** (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network) and **SRGAN** (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network). We evaluate their performance on metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and MSE, using augmented datasets of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) satellite images.

The study focuses on upscaling geospatial images (e.g., from 64x64 to 256x256) for applications in remote sensing, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. Key insights include how SRGAN's adversarial training produces more perceptually realistic results compared to SRCNN's MSE-based approach.

This project is inspired by research on super-resolution of Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite imagery, adapting techniques to enhance medium-resolution (5m/pixel) images to high-resolution (1m/pixel) outputs for better analysis in land monitoring and disaster management.
